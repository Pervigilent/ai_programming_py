## Pathfinding and the A-Star Algorithm (2)
### Depth-First Search
The depth-first search first searches each branch of a search tree. The depth-first search demonstrated here is a pathfinding algorithm that uses a stack.
### Breadth-First Search
The breadth-first search first searches each adjacent node of a tree. The breadth-first search demonstrated here is a pathfinding algorithm that uses a queue.
### A-Star Search

## Simulated Annealing (3)
Simulated annnealing uses a decreasing temperature to simulate the annealing process. The solution is ranked according to a metric and worse solutions are rejected at a lower temperature. The algorithm always accepts solutions with a lower metric than the current solution. It accepts solutions with a higher entropy with less probability according to a function which gives the probability of acceptance based on the temperature.

The problem demonstrated in this application is the N-queens problem which asks how one can arrange N queens on an N-by-N board so that no one queen is attacking another queen. One queen is assumed to occupy each column. There for the rows on which the queen resides is represented as a N-dimensional vector called the solution.
